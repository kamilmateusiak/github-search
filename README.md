# GITHUB SEARCH

`Tooploox Recruitment Exercise`

The App built in React library. An user can search github users by login and the results will be shown two boxes - one with basic informations, other with 3 most popular repositories titles.

## Basic available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
I decided to test only data layer and one react custom hook - no snapshot testing of components since it's pretty useless in my opinion.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
The app is ready to be deployed!
